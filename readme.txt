This repository contains codes and tools associated with the paper titled 
"Pushing the speed limit of constant-time discreteGaussian sampling. A case study on Falcon." to appear in DAC 2019.

1. The Falcon folder contains the implementation of Falcon signature with our bit-sliced constant time discrete Gaussian sampler.

2. The Standalon sampler contains implementation of bit-sliced constant time discrete Gaussian sampler for two different standard deviations.

3. The Gaussian_tool folder contains the tool to generate a bit-sliced constant-time discrete Gaussian sampler for arbitrary n and sigma.
